## Problem Statement

The main goal of the creation of Chatbots was to resemble a human being in the way they perform said interaction, trying to make the user think writing to another human being. 
This chatbot uses Amazon lex to build a text-based conversational interface for web applications. 
AWS lambda function is used to validate user’s response and perform initialization and fulfilment in lex intent configuration. This chatbot uses AWS DynamoDB to control and stores the resources. The bot is deployed onAWS Cloud Formation. 
The application architecture uses AWS Lambda, Amazon Lex, Amazon DynamoDB, to communicate with the application deployed.
The chatbot is built to provide customer support 24x7, especially in the health domain web applications. This will help the user to interact with doctors at any time online and to search for the doctor’s availability and book Appointment etc.This type of chatbot can be deployed in any application by using AWS tools.
